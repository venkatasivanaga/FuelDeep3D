Description: Provides an R interface for training and applying deep learning models
    to terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) 3D point clouds for forest fuel applications.
    The package wraps a height-aware PointNet-style architecture,
    enabling users to build HAG-based features, train classifiers, and generate
    per-point fuel classes (e.g., stem, branches, canopy, surface fuels) for use in
    wildfire and fuel complexity analysis workflows.
